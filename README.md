### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. The <script></script> allows you to reference the JavaScript inside the index.html file to link the two together. This is put before the </body> tag in the index.html.
2. The fadeIn("") determines the speed at which the text shows up, you can either put fast or slow inside the quotes.
3. The click(display) lets the h3 be invoked once clicked and that is what activates it.
